# My Shared Libraries

This project contains libraries used all over my projects.

-----

## Database Manager

This is a basic class that handles an in-memory database and saves it using JSON.

Has object edit tracking, but a function must be called in order to be registered immediately.

-----

## Result

An object that tries to imitate Result<OK, Error> in Rust. 

Probably not worth the extra allocated memory, but still, I like my extended null-safety.

-----

## StreamSpreader

A class that *spreads* data from one source to multiple streams using multiple threads.
